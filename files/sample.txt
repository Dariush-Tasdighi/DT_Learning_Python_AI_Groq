Last night I could hear them again. They make so little noise that I do not understand how it can carry through the corridors of this house. But carry it does. It is hard enough to sleep, gravid and swollen as I am; and once I hear it I cannot turn my thoughts away from it. So when that silken whisper began to tug at me I dragged myself to my feet to answer the summons. I drew on a wrapper, because the half-hearted English summer night did not warm me past the top of my skin, and padded on naked feet down the stairs and through the dim passages until I came into the orangery. The moon was full, dazzling among the foliage of the olive and lemon trees, glinting through the stinking juniper. If it had not been for the walls and windows I might have thought myself transported – and I caught myself thinking: home. But that Mediterranean island was not home; it was never home, no matter how much I longed to belong there, no matter how I yearned to lose myself forever in the midday shade of the evergreen forests. I should have remembered that I am an Englishwoman, a Christian, alien and pale- skinned and above all James’s wife. If I had held tight to those undeniable facts – if I had kept faith – then … Oh, but it is done, it is over, it is no good now.
